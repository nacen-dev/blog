## The Golden Circle

![Golden Circle](/golden-circle.jpg)

The book revolves around the idea of the Golden Circle which have three components **WHY**, **HOW**, and **WHAT**.

- **WHY** the clear sense of purpose, a cause, a belief.

- **HOW** the actions taken to bring **WHY** into life.

- **WHAT** the result of **HOW** the tangible proof of your **WHY**.

## Where to start?

### WHY

When you have the clarity of your **WHY**, it acts as a compass that guides you to make decisions and actions that will align with your purpose. It provides the framework on where to base **HOW** you do **WHAT** you do.

We humans are social creatures and we have a need to belong. It is a desire to be part of something greater.

When **WHY** is clear, it can resonate and it will reasonate to becomes visible to others, it transforms into a shared purpose that can inspire belief and action.

### HOW

Once you have your **WHY**, you now need to know **HOW** to transform that intangible purpose into something that is actionable and tangible. Creating the systems, processes, and structures to bring **WHY** into life.

### WHAT

Know your **WHY**, understand **HOW**, then define your **WHAT**.

**WHAT** is the tangible proof of **WHY**; it is the result of **HOW**. Everything you say and do should consistently align with your **WHY**.

Consistently aligning **WHAT** with **WHY** reinforces that purpose and belief, which builds credibility and trust, creating an authentic image that resonates with others.

## Final Thoughts

I feel blessed to work for a company that knows its **WHY**, understands **HOW** to bring it to life, and consistently demonstrates its **WHAT** to reflect that purpose.

I highly recommend this book as the lessons are not only relevant to leadership but also to our own selves.

- **WHY** is your purpose, vision, or belief.
- **HOW** is the action that needs to be taken to bring your **WHY** to life.
- **WHAT** is the outcome of your **HOW** and the tangible proof of your **WHY**.
